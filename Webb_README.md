# WPFAirline
For this project I mostly dealt with handling the logic behind with handling the data and databinding to the WPF. It was interesting since I did not get a chance to do this in my previous WPF project (which this one totally obliterated). My partner Christian was awesome to work with and really took a grasping on designing the UI. I still feel kinda bad just dumping a lot on him when he came back after he was absent for a day but glad it turned out for the best.

There are still some things I wish could've changed, such as getting the file reader to work and possibly changing the UI to be more user interactive and robust.
