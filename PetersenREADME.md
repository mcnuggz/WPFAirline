# WPFAirline

I would have to say that the WPF project was the most enjoyable project to work on so far.
It is always enjoyable to advance from a simple console application to a user interface because it allows me to be more creative with code.
Ryan was my partner, and I would say that I was pretty lucky to have him on my team.  I found myself struggling a little bit with the business logic,
which Ryan was able to compensate for while providing education so I understood what was going on rather than just going with the flow.
Overall, I am proud of what we were able to accomplish over the week given the topic was new and we did not receive a single lecture on the material.
If the deadline was extended I would have liked to incorporate an interactive seating chart diagram for each aircraft that the user could just point and click on the available seats.
As for the criticism received, I recognize that I may have crossed the border as to what is perceived as professional and I should have stuck with my original idea -
  to have Betty thinking about Puppies.
